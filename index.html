                This site is a project of mine done for fun over winter break to grow my frontend development skills. There are some hidden easter eggs to find.<br>

            <h1>Software</h1>
            Showcases of some of my projects: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwwPUm6b0wU">Stock App</a> and <a href="youtube.com/watch?v=uFzk7ieOfIY&feature=youtu.be">AI sports betting bot</a>
            <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
            <p>
                Backend: Java, Python, C#, C <br>
                Frontend: JavaScript, HTML, CSS <br>
                Other Langauges: SQL, Assembly, R <br>
            </p>
            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>
                I have practiced the agile and scrum development method for software design and deployment. This was used during my 
                previous semester, in which my group developed a web application together. Eech team member was resposible for being
                a scrum master during a period of the semester. We also had practice with managing sprints, and using planning poker. 
                The curriculum included learning about the strengths and weaknesses of agile <br>
                I have also practiced comment first development and test first development as strategies
            </p>
            <h2>Software Tools and Frameworks</h2>
            <p>
                Git, Github, GitLab: <br>
                I have used Git for professional and personal projects. Creating branches, dealing with Merge Requests,
                creating issues and using an issue board, adding weight to issues, and using a CI/CD pipeline. <br>
                <br>
                Spring boot: <br>
                My team used Spring boot as the backend framework for our stock app. Part of my role was to run the spring boot app
                in the docker container. <br>
                <br>
                Docker: <br>
                I created the docker container for our web app which included the Dockerfile and the docker compose yaml file.
                These were used to containerize our project with the spring boot and the DB, and later it was helpful in transitioning our project to a virtual machine <br>
                <br>
                MySQL: <br>
                MySQL was our DB of choice to manage the backend data for our project. It had two tables: A user table that contained
                the information like their id, email, a current balance; and a table of transactions that were paired with the 
                user table. The transaction table contained what type of transaction was made, if stocks were involved, what user id
                it is paired with, etc. I created the entity class for the User, and queried through the transaction table 
                when creating a portfolio history for a user. <br>
                <br>
                APIs: <br>
                I have used APIs in different types of projects to communicate information between softwares. I have used Clerk for 
                authentification and used REST to communicate between the frontend and backend. <br>
                <br>
                JUnit: <br>
                I have used JUnit many times to test my code. It my best way to test, although I still often use the print/log method 
                more than I should. <br>
                <br>
                React: <br>
                My stock project used React as our frontend framework, this meant I did use and experience it. However, I was a backend
                developer and did not personally program much with it. I am taking a frontend React class this spring semester. 
            </p>
            <h2>AI</h2>
            <p>
                I recently created an AI sports betting bot using Python and the OpenAI API. The bot makes api calls to get the latest
                odds of NFL games, then uses the OpenAI API to analyze the data and make bets based on predicted outcomes. The API call
                and portions of the analysis were done by providing tools to the LLM and having it decide when to use them. <br>
                I have used AI LLMs like ChatGPT and Copilot for use in programming. The best use has been using it to help understand
                and resolve errors. I have spent time learning how to effectively use AI to improve my skills and understanding <br>
                I do feel it is important to never rely on the technology. I review each line of code written by AI and do not use it to 
                do things I do not understand. I make sure that AI is only used to improve the speed of my work rather than replacing
                learning or practice with it.<br>
                This semester, I am taking a course on AI, LLMs, and Machine Learning.

            <h1>Game Development</h1>
            <p>
                My itch page can be found here: <a href="https://drcoy.itch.io/">drcoy</a>. All games I have made in class, free time,
                or game jams can be found here. <br>
                It has been a dream of mine since I was a kid to be a video game developer. I have been writing down ideas for games
                since I was 10 years old. I also made games within games like Minecraft maps and minigames. <br>
                <br>
                <h2>Skills and Tools</h2>
                I have experience with Unity and C# as well as GameMaker Studio 2. <br>
                I have done been the primary developer on all of the projects on my itch page. <br>
                2D games have been my priority but I do have time spent in 3D game development as well.<br>
                Level desgin and game mechanics are my favorite parts of game development. I enjoy designing the flow of a level
                and using the mechanics of the game to create fun and interesting challanges. My "Crappy Ninja" game 
                is the best example of this. I designed all of the levels during the week long game jam. <br>

            <h1>Life</h1>
            <p>
                I am a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a member of the wrestling team. Wrestling has been
                a huge part of my life and has taught me very valuable lessons about displice and failure. 
                Currently I am still recovering from shoulder surgery, which has come with its own lessons about 
                being able to accept circumstances and find new goals. <br>
                <br>
                I grew up in Pittsburgh PA, and enjoy all three major sports teams from the city. Pittsburgh is also where I began
                learning to program. I took CS classes in middle and high school, and really enjoyed the problem solving that comes with it.
                I see the projects I create, including this site, as peices of art and enjoy creating things for others to use and enjoy.
                That may include enjoying the convience of it or enjoying that a problem was solved. <br>
                <br>
                In my free time I enjoy playing video games and going on hikes with my fiance. I watch lots of baking shows with her as well.
                I have a cat names Isabella who I adopted a year ago. She loves to sit near me while I work late on projects. <br>
