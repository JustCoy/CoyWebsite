                This site is a project of mine done for fun over winter break to grow my frontend development skills. There are lots of hidden easter eggs to find.<br>

            <h1>Software</h1>
            <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
            <p>
                Backend: Java, Python, C#, C <br>
                Frontend: JavaScript, HTML, CSS <br>
                Other Langauges: SQL, Assembly, R <br>
            </p>
            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>
                I have practiced the agile and scrum development method for software design and deployment. This was used during my 
                previous semester, in which my group developed a web application together. Eech team member was resposible for being
                a scrum master during a period of the semester. We also had practice with managing sprints, and using planning poker. 
                The curriculum included learning about the strengths and weaknesses of agile <br>
                I have also practiced comment first development and test first development as strategies
            </p>
            <h2>Software Tools and Frameworks</h2>
            <p>
                Git, Github, GitLab: <br>
                I have used Git for professional and personal projects. Creating branches, dealing with Merge Requests,
                creating issues and using an issue board, adding weight to issues, and using a CI/CD pipeline. <br>
                <br>
                Spring boot: <br>
                My team used Spring boot as the backend framework for our stock app. Part of my role was to run the spring boot app
                in the docker container. <br>
                <br>
                Docker: <br>
                I created the docker container for our web app which included the Dockerfile and the docker compose yaml file.
                These were used to containerize our project with the spring boot and the DB, and later it was helpful in transitioning our project to a virtual machine <br>
                <br>
                MySQL: <br>
                MySQL was our DB of choice to manage the backend data for our project. It had two tables: A user table that contained
                the information like their id, email, a current balance; and a table of transactions that were paired with the 
                user table. The transaction table contained what type of transaction was made, if stocks were involved, what user id
                it is paired with, etc. I created the entity class for the User, and queried through the transaction table 
                when creating a portfolio history for a user. <br>
                <br>
                APIs: <br>
                I have used APIs in different types of projects to communicate information between softwares. I have used Clerk for 
                authentification and used REST to communicate between the frontend and backend. <br>
                <br>
                JUnit: <br>
                I have used JUnit many times to test my code. It my best way to test, although I still often use the print/log method 
                more than I should. <br>
                <br>
                React: <br>
                My stock project used React as our frontend framework, this meant I did use and experience it. However, I was a backend
                developer and did not personally program much with it. I am taking a frontend React class this spring semester. 
            </p>
            <h2>AI</h2>
            <p>
                I have used AI LLMs like ChatGPT and Copilot for use in programming. The best use has been using it to help understand
                and resolve errors. I have spent time learning how to effectively use AI to improve my skills and understanding <br>
                I do feel it is important to never rely on the technolgy. I review each line of code written by AI and do not use it to 
                do things I do not understand. <br>
                This semester, I am taking a course on AI, LLMs, and Machine Learning.
